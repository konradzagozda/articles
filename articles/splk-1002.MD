# Splunk Power User Certification (SPLK-1002)

Recently I undertook SPLK-1002 certification. It was a great experience and incentive for learning about splunk core product.

Here I share the concepts required to pass the exam and my way of learning. For official materials see [Training & Certification](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/training/certification-track/splunk-core-certified-power-user.html).

## Concepts covered by exam

## 1. Setup a Playground

For testing concepts in real product.

1. Setup splunk[^1] with docker[^2]

```bash
# try without --platform first, if it fails then use --platform linux/x86_64
# replace <host_port> with the port you want to expose splunk on your host machine e.g. 8000
# replace <password> with your desired password, it will be your admin password
docker run -d -p <host_port>:8000 --platform linux/x86_64 \
    -e SPLUNK_START_ARGS='--accept-license' \
    -e SPLUNK_PASSWORD='<password>' splunk/splunk:latest
```

If you're on mac with arm64 archtecture you can still use `linux/x86_64` splunk image and it should work good enough for experiments.

2. Login to splunk at`localhost:<host_port>` with `admin:<passowrd>`

### 2. Prepare AI assistant

1. Choose your AI assistant
   At a time of writing I recommend `gemini experimental 1206` available at <https://aistudio.google.com/> but you can use any other AI assistant you want.

2. Setup system prompt for example and experiment generation e.g. here is my prompt:

```text
- I want to learn about splunk for certification: splunk power user certificate splk-1002
- You're splunk consultant and teacher with a lot of hands-on experience.
- do not use comments within SPL
- If I want example, I'm asking for "makeresults" first and "collect" as a first step, always load to "main" index. these should be atleast 100 events generated.

example of mocking data:

| makeresults count=150
| eval \_time = \_time - random() % (60*60*24\*14)
| eval ip_address = case(
random() % 4 == 0, "192.168.1." . (random() % 255),
random() % 4 == 1, "10.0.0." . (random() % 255),
random() % 4 == 2, "172.16." . (random() % 32) . "." .(random() % 255),
1==1, "unknown"
)
| eval http_method = mvindex(split("GET,POST,PUT,DELETE,HEAD", ","), random() % 5)
| eval url = mvindex(split("/home,/about,/products,/cart,/login,/logout", ","), random() % 6)
| eval http_status = mvindex(split("200,201,400,404,500", ","), random() % 5)
| eval bytes = random() % 4096
| collect index=main sourcetype="example_no_2"

- awlays include different sourcetype so I can reference my events easily
- always collect to the main index with unique sourcetype per example
- if you need to concatenate always use period (.) to avoid type issues
- if I'm asking for multiple examples in one prompt I mean to reuse mocked data
```

### Try it out

Ask about any concept and get examples. e.g.

- can you explain me timechart on 2-3 different examples?
- can you guide me how to use field extractor in splunk UI?

gemini is super smart about UI of splunk, it almost know it by heart.
