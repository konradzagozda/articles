# Splunk Power User Certification (SPLK-1002)

I recently completed the SPLK-1002 certification. It was a great experience and a strong motivator to learn more about Splunk's core product. Here I share the concepts required to pass the exam and my learning approach. For official materials see [Training & Certification](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/training/certification-track/splunk-core-certified-power-user.html).

## 1. Setup a Playground

Setting up a local Splunk environment for hands-on learning

1. Setup splunk[^1] with docker[^2]

```bash
# try without --platform first, if it fails then use --platform linux/x86_64
# replace <host_port> with the port you want to expose splunk on your host machine e.g. 8000
# replace <password> with your desired password, it will be your admin password
docker run -d -p <host_port>:8000 --platform linux/x86_64 \
    -e SPLUNK_START_ARGS='--accept-license' \
    -e SPLUNK_PASSWORD='<password>' splunk/splunk:latest
```

If you're on Mac with ARM64 architecture, you can still use the `linux/x86_64` Splunk image, and it should work well enough for experiments.

2. Login to Splunk at`localhost:<host_port>` with `admin:<password>`

### 2. Prepare AI assistant

1. Choose your AI assistant. At the time of writing, I recommend gemini experimental 1206 available at <https://aistudio.google.com/> but you can use any other AI assistant you want.

2. Set up the system prompt for example and experiment generation. Here is my prompt:

```text
- I want to learn about splunk for certification: splunk power user certificate splk-1002
- You're splunk consultant and teacher with a lot of hands-on experience.
- do not use comments within SPL
- If I want example, I'm asking for "makeresults" first and "collect" as a first step, always collect to the main index. these should be atleast 100 events generated.

example of mocking data:

| makeresults count=150
| eval \_time = \_time - random() % (60*60*24\*14)
| eval ip_address = case(
random() % 4 == 0, "192.168.1." . (random() % 255),
random() % 4 == 1, "10.0.0." . (random() % 255),
random() % 4 == 2, "172.16." . (random() % 32) . "." .(random() % 255),
1==1, "unknown"
)
| eval http_method = mvindex(split("GET,POST,PUT,DELETE,HEAD", ","), random() % 5)
| eval url = mvindex(split("/home,/about,/products,/cart,/login,/logout", ","), random() % 6)
| eval http_status = mvindex(split("200,201,400,404,500", ","), random() % 5)
| eval bytes = random() % 4096
| collect index=main sourcetype="example_no_2"

- awlays include different sourcetype so I can reference my events easily
- always collect to the main index with unique sourcetype per example
- if you need to concatenate always use period (.) to avoid type issues
- if I'm asking for multiple examples in one prompt I mean to reuse mocked data
```

### Practice and Learning

Ask your AI assistant to explore the concepts, for example:

- `Could you demonstrate the timechart command with 2-3 different examples?`
- `Please walk me through using the field extractor in the Splunk user interface.`

Gemini demonstrates strong knowledge of Splunk's interface and provides detailed instructions for using the UI.
Each section of concepts has an AI-generated audio podcast complement created with NotebookLM, allowing you to listen to related content during breaks. Please treat these as basic introductions and verify all information, as the AI actors may occasionally provide incorrect information.
If you're preparing for the exam, I hope this has been helpful. Good luck!
